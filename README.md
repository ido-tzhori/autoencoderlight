# Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder for Soccer Highlight Detection

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a spatio-temporal autoencoder designed for the purpose of detecting highlights in soccer matches. The model processes video data to identify segments such as goals and penalties by analyzing the reconstruction error over time.

## Example of Reconstruction Error
Below is an example of how the reconstruction error visualizes over time for a soccer match video. Segments with lower error values potentially indicate highlights.
